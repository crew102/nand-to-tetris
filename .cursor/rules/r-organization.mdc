# Code Organization and Implementation Philosophy

## File Organization
- Group related chips in the same file
- Use section headers to separate different categories
- Place more complex chips after simpler building blocks
- Include explanatory comments about the implementation approach

## Implementation Philosophy
- Build complex chips from simpler building blocks
- Use only the basic gates (nand, and, or, xor, not) and previously built chips
- Comment on the logical arrangement and how signals flow through the system
- Think in terms of electrical signals and gate arrangements
- Each chip should be built using only previously defined chips and the base nand gate

## Code Structure
- Start with the simplest building blocks
- Build up complexity gradually
- Each function should have a clear, single purpose
- Functions should be composable and reusable
