# Comment Style Guidelines

## Section Headers
- Use descriptive comments with `#` followed by the section name
- Examples:
  - `# MULTI-BIT GATES (array) inputs, AKA buses`
  - `# ---- Intro ----`
  - `# ARITHMETIC CHIPS`
  - `# BASIC GATES`

## HDL References
- Before each function, include an HDL reference comment
- Format: `# HDL: ChipName.hdl`
- Example: `# HDL: HalfAdder.hdl`
- Place HDL comment immediately before the function definition

## Function Documentation
- Include descriptive comments explaining:
  - What the chip does
  - Input/output specifications
  - Implementation approach or logic
- Use inline comments to explain complex logic steps
- Include truth tables or examples in comments when helpful

## Examples in Comments
- Include example truth tables or bit patterns in comments when they help clarify behavior
- Use markdown-style tables in comments for readability
- Show example inputs/outputs when the logic is non-obvious
